# Zero Trust Architecture

A comprehensive Zero Trust Architecture implementation for hybrid cloud environments, featuring identity-based access control, policy enforcement, and comprehensive monitoring.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This system implements a complete Zero Trust stack with the following components:

### Core Services
- **Keycloak**: Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent)**: Policy enforcement engine
- **Kong**: API Gateway with mTLS support
- **Backend Service**: Node.js application with role-based access control
- **PostgreSQL**: Database with encrypted connections

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Dashboards for infrastructure and security monitoring
- **Alertmanager**: Multi-channel alert notifications (Email, Slack)
- **ELK Stack**: Log aggregation and analysis
- **Node Exporter**: System metrics collection

### Security Features
- **mTLS**: Mutual TLS authentication between services
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- OpenSSL (for certificate generation)

### 1. Setup and Deploy
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rifushigi/zta-poc.git
cd zta-poc

# Generate certificates and setup networks
./scripts/setup.sh

# Deploy the entire stack
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### 2. Access Services
- **API Gateway**: https://localhost:8443
- **Keycloak Admin**: http://localhost:8080 (admin/admin)
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Alertmanager**: http://localhost:9093
- **Kibana**: http://localhost:5601

### 3. Configure Monitoring
```bash
# Configure alert notifications
cd monitoring
./configure-alerts.sh
```

## üìä Monitoring Dashboards

### Infrastructure Dashboard
- Service health and availability
- Performance metrics (response times, throughput)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- Error rates and failure patterns

### Security Dashboard
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Authorization decisions and policy evaluation
- JWT token validation statistics
- Rate limiting and suspicious activity
- Certificate expiry monitoring

## üîî Alerting

The monitoring stack includes comprehensive alerting:

- **Service Health**: Automatic detection of service failures
- **Performance**: High error rates and response times
- **Security**: Authentication failures and suspicious activity
- **Infrastructure**: Resource exhaustion and certificate expiry

### Notification Channels
- **Slack**: General alerts and security notifications
- **Email**: Critical alerts to admin and security teams
- **Webhook**: Integration with external systems

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Identity & Access Management
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- JWT token management
- Session management

### Policy Enforcement
- Fine-grained authorization policies
- Real-time policy evaluation
- Audit trail for all decisions
- Policy versioning and rollback

### Network Security
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) between services
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Encrypted communication channels
- Certificate management

### Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Security headers and CORS policies
- Comprehensive audit logging

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run security tests
npm run test:security
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test API endpoints
./scripts/test-api.sh

# Test authentication flow
./scripts/test-auth.sh

# Test policy enforcement
./scripts/test-policies.sh
```

## üìà Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Application performance metrics
- Security event metrics
- Infrastructure metrics
- Custom business metrics

### Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log retention and rotation
- Security event correlation

### Tracing
- Distributed request tracing
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error correlation across services

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Key configuration options are available via environment variables:

```bash
# Database
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=backend
DB_PASSWORD=backendpass
DB_NAME=zerotrust

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
NODE_ENV=production

# Monitoring
PROMETHEUS_PORT=9090
GRAFANA_PORT=3001
```

### Customization
- Modify policies in `policies/` directory
- Update API gateway configuration in `services/api-gateway/`
- Customize dashboards in `monitoring/`
- Add new alert rules in `monitoring/alerts.yml`

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Setup production environment
./scripts/setup-production.sh

# Deploy with production config
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Verify deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Automated deployment to staging/production
- Rollback capabilities
